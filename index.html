	About Me -- Andrew Faust
	</h1>
	<p>
		I grew up in Washington Court House Ohio. I attended Washington Senior Highschool where I graduated with an
	honors diploma. I was involved in several clubs at school as well as being involved in some community activities.
	Some of the highschool clubs I was involved in were Hi - Y , Youth in Government, Quick Recall, and DECA. In
	terms of the ommunity activites I was involved in I was a participent in a local food pantry called Bread
	Of Life(run through my church) as well as being an active member in my local church.
		Here in college I am involved in several different projects. Currently we are working on a reaserch project
	for SIGVRSTS that involves cutting edge reaserch for virtual reality. I am also involved in a class called 
	CS 196 where we are working on software that simulates chemical reactions.

	High School Activities

	<h3 class - center>
	Hi-Y
	</h3>
	<p>
		Hi-Y is a club where we did community service. Some of these included raising money for the MDA via bakes sales as well as 
	volunteering at local food pantries. Our largest even was called "Homeless For a Day" where we build a city out of cardboard on 
	our schools property and stood outside all day to raise money for the local food pantry. This club was especially meaningful beause
	we really felt that we were making a difference in the community with our activities.

	Quick Recall
	</h3>
	<p>
	Quick recall was a club similar to a quiz bowl. We competed in a local league as well as competing at some competitions in other locations
	around Ohio. This was never a club that I participated heavily in but I did find it fun to test the random that I had against that of other
	kids. This club provided an invaluabloe atmostphere for all of us becuase of the type of people that participated in this club.

	Youth In Government
	</h3>
	<p>
	Youth in government was an activity that involved students from around the state going to the capitol for a day to take over the capitol building
	and act as the government of Ohio. I participated in both the legislative and judicial branches. In the legislative branch I wrote bills both for 
	providing more AP opportunities for students and for mandating that schools start later. The former of these passed through the student legislature
	and was actually introduced into the actuall legislature. This expierence was so unique and it allowed me to see from an internal perspective
	how our government operates. It also allowed me to debate over large issues with people from much different backgrounds than myself. Overall this
	was an extremely enriching expierence for me as a person and as a student.
	</p>
	<h3 class = center>DECA</h3>
	<p>
	DECA is a career rediness program that tests students' interaction with adults and mastery of specific business material. My personal even was business
	finance and so I was required to have in depth knowlege of how the financial industry works including anything from stocks to details about the 
	Sarbanes-Oxley act of 2002. I did this as a team event and my partner and I took second place at state competition the first year and first place the
	second year we participated. This event increased my interpersonal skills as this was a large part of what we were being tested over aside from the
	actual material itself. This allowed me to get out to my shell so to speak and learn to interact with adults in a professional manner.
